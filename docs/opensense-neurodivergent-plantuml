' ===== NOTES AND ANNOTATIONS =====
note right of MF1
    **Genetic Distance = 0**
    Direct genetic pairing
    Forms base phenotype
end note

note bottom of NDIndividual
    **Core Hypothesis:**
    Neurodivergence emerges at
    genetic intersection points
    where family trait patterns
    create unique expressions
end note

note left of UIAdapter
    **Bidirectional Principle:**
    User → System: Express needs
    System → User: Adapt interface
    
    "When systems fail,
    build your own"
end note
